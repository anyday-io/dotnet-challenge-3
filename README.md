This is a console application in .NET 8. The business idea is to handle account transactions (just income and expense or credit and debit)

To be solved:

1. Fix/Apply comments on the code.
2. Implement and use the method CalculateBalance(), when user input "4. View Balance" choice.
3. Error handling to ensure no exception will be thrown with any user inputs.
4. Make code generic.
